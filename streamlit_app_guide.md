# Enhanced Guide: Building a Streamlit App with `LidaManager.py`

This guide details constructing a Streamlit application that leverages `LidaManager.py` for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive data querying, known as "Chat with Data". The app includes a user input sidebar and dynamically adjustable sections for displaying results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer.
- Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`).
- `LidaManager.py` and its dependencies properly installed and configured in your project.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup

Ensure you have a Streamlit app file, typically named `app.py`, which imports necessary modules from Streamlit and your `LidaManager.py`. Structure your project directory to keep your code organized.

```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st
from LidaManager import DataLoader, LidaEDA, LidaChat
```

### Step 2: Implementing Sidebar for 'Chat with Data'

Design a sidebar that allows users to input queries. The sidebar should contain an input field and a submission button.

```python
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Chat with Data")
    user_query = st.text_input("Enter your query here:")
    ask_button = st.button("Ask")
```

### Step 3: Main Body for 'Exploratory Data Analysis'

Include a dedicated section in the main app body for performing EDA. Feature an action button that users can click to initiate the analysis.

```python
st.header("Exploratory Data Analysis")
if st.button("Analyze Data", key="analyze"):
    # Placeholder for LidaEDA instantiation and data processing
```

### Step 4: Using Expander Widgets for Results Display

To efficiently manage screen real estate and improve user experience, utilize expander widgets. Implement session states to track which expander should be open at any given time.

```python
# Initialize or update session states for expander control
if 'expand_eda' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['expand_eda'] = False
if 'expand_chat' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['expand_chat'] = False

# Logic to control the state of expanders based on user interaction
# Include processing logic for EDA and chat within these conditions

# Expander widget placeholders for displaying results
eda_expander = st.expander("EDA Results", expanded=st.session_state['expand_eda'])
chat_expander = st.expander("Chat Results", expanded=st.session_state['expand_chat'])
```

### Step 5: Displaying Results

Develop the logic for presenting the outcomes of EDA and chat interactions within the respective expanders. Ensure your `LidaEDA` and `LidaChat` classes have methods that return results in a format suitable for display.

```python
# Inside the EDA expander
with eda_expander:
    # Example: Display EDA results
    st.write(st.session_state['eda_results'])
    # Assuming 'eda_images' is a list of image paths or PIL images
    for img in eda_images:
        st.image(img)

# Inside the Chat expander
with chat_expander:
    # Example: Display chat interaction results
    st.write(st.session_state['chat_results'])
    if chat_image:  # Assuming chat_image is a path to an image or a PIL image
        st.image(chat_image)
    else:
        st.write("No image to display.")
```

## Wrapping Up

After implementing the steps above, your Streamlit app will have a structured interface allowing users to interact with data through chat and visualize EDA results dynamically. Ensure to test each component and adjust the `LidaManager.py` methods to suit your specific data processing and analysis needs.

### Debugging Tips

- Use Streamlit's `st.write()` function to debug variables and states within your app.
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and imported within your Python environment.
- Regularly check the Streamlit documentation for updates and best practices.

### Extending Your App

Consider enhancing your app with additional features such as:

- Advanced data filtering options in the sidebar.
- Interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.
- Integration with external APIs for broader data analysis capabilities.

With these steps and tips, you're set to build a powerful Streamlit app that offers insightful data analysis and interactive querying features.
