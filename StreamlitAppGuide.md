# Streamlit App with LidaManager.py Extended Guide

This guide elaborates on creating a Streamlit app that utilizes `LidaManager.py` for both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive data querying (Chat with Data). The app features a sidebar for user input and dynamically expandable sections in the main content area to display results.

## Setup

Ensure you have Streamlit and all required dependencies installed. Your `LidaManager.py` should be correctly set up with necessary imports.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Initial Setup

Start with the basic setup as previously outlined, ensuring `app.py` includes necessary imports from both Streamlit and `LidaManager.py`.

### Step 2: Sidebar for 'Chat with Data'

Implement the sidebar with an input field for user queries and an "Ask" button.

```python
with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Chat with Data")
    user_query = st.text_input("Enter your query here:")
    ask_button = st.button("Ask")
```

### Step 3: Main Body for 'Exploratory Data Analysis'

Create a section in the main body for EDA, including an "Analyze Data" button.

```python
st.header("Exploratory Data Analysis")
if st.button("Analyze Data", key="analyze"):
    # Instantiate and use LidaEDA here to process data
```

### Step 4: Expander Widgets for Results

Use session states to manage which expander is open, simulating mutual exclusivity in their expansion.

```python
# Initialize session states
if 'expand_eda' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['expand_eda'] = False

if 'expand_chat' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['expand_chat'] = False

# Update states based on user interaction
if st.button("Analyze Data", key="analyze"):
    st.session_state['expand_eda'] = True
    st.session_state['expand_chat'] = False
    # EDA processing and display logic here

if ask_button and user_query:
    st.session_state['expand_chat'] = True
    st.session_state['expand_eda'] = False
    # Chat processing and display logic here

# Expander placeholders
eda_expander = st.expander("EDA Results", expanded=st.session_state['expand_eda'])
chat_expander = st.expander("Chat Results", expanded=st.session_state['expand_chat'])

with eda_expander:
    # Display EDA results here

with chat_expander:
    # Display chat results here
```

### Step 5: Displaying Results

Implement the logic to display results from your `LidaEDA` and `LidaChat` processes within each expander.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a structured approach to creating a Streamlit app with dynamic content based on user input and automated data processing. Adapt it as necessary to match the specifics of your `LidaManager.py` implementation.
